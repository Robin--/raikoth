# Raikoth

[Scott Alexander](http://slatestarcodex.com/)'s fictional society of [Raikoth](http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/15/index-posts-on-raikoth/) represents a framework for governance worth exploring.

The [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) platform provides a number of features which may theoretically be leveraged to implement at least some parts of the Raikoth infrastructure.

This project is an attempt to implement Raikoth as an organizational entity on the Ethereum network.
